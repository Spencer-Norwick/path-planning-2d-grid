# path-planning-2d-grid
A project implementing A* algorithm in Python for path planning on a 2D grid.


Path Planning on a 2D Grid

Objective: I'm building this project to explore the fundamentals of path planning. Success looks like a visual agent efficiently and consistently navigates from start to end points on a 2D grid leveraging the A* algorithm. Why A*?

Project Outline:

Goal: To implement an A* pathfinding algorithm in Python, visualize the planned path, and gain foundational navigation knowledge applicable to autonomous vehicle development.
Technologies Used: Python, matplotlib (for visualization).
Key Concepts:
Graph traversal and heuristic search.
Pathfinding in the context of autonomous systems.
Structure:

src/: Contains the main Python code.
docs/: Diagrams and visual outputs of the project.
tests/: Any unit tests to validate functionality.
